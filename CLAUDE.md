# Project Guidelines

## Change Log

After completing every task, append a summary to `changes.md` in the project root. Each entry should include:

- **Date** (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **What changed** — brief description of the task
- **Files modified** — list of files created, modified, or deleted
- **Key details** — any important implementation notes, new dependencies, or breaking changes

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — Short task title

**What:** One-sentence summary of what was done.

**Files:**
- `path/to/file.py` — created / modified / deleted (brief note)

**Details:**
- Bullet points with key implementation details if needed
```

Create `changes.md` if it doesn't exist. Always append — never overwrite previous entries.
